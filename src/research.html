<h1>General context: particle physics</h1>
<p>
  The question is conceptually quite simple: <span id="ImportantPart">what are we made of?</span> Particle physics attemps to address this question by studying the elementary particle
  (<i>ie.</i> the one which are not made of something else) and how they interact together to form different composit system up to our human-scale matter
  that one can touch and see. At the very small scale, the particle are actually described by fields which obey to quantum dynamics (each particle appears to be a
  quantum of vibration of the corresponding field). In this mathematical description, <span id="ImportantPart">symmetries are the corner stone of the structure of the theory</span>.
  Indeed for both free particle and interacting particle, specific invariances strongly constrain the structure of field dynamics, thus particles behaviour.

<h3>The Standard Model</h3>
<p>
The Standard Model is the current mathematical framework which allows a quite extensive and precise prediction of plenty of observations at the sub-atomic scale.
The basic ingredients are quantum fields and symmetries. In spite of very attractive features - such as understanding three of the fourth fundamental interactions as coming from
a similar symmetry, and predictions - like the existence of neutral current discovered at CERN in 1984), <span id="ImportantPart">few observational and conceptual questions remain open</span>.
To mentione just an example for both conceptual and observational aspects: the gravitation cannot be described in the Standard Model and we do know by experiment that neutrinos
are massive (unlike in the Standard Model).
 </p>
</div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="container-fluid">
<div class="col-md-8 vcenter">
<h3>How to improve our understanding of Nature?</h3>
<p>
  One of the most appealing feature of the Standard Model is to <span id="ImportantPart">unify the electromagnetic force and the weak force</span> into the so-called electro-weak interaction. This unification
  should be happening at high energy and that is why these two interactions look different at our scale. What makes the transition between the unified interaction and how they appear to us?
  The Higgs field, and its associated particle <span id="ImportantPart">the Higgs boson, plays a crucial role in this question</span> and its discovery and study is clearly a good area to look to push further our understanding.
<p/>
<p>
  Another option (and it is cleary a non-exhaustive list) is study particles which seems a bit peculiar with respect to the others. In the Standard Model, the top quark is a bit appart because
  he is the heaviest matter particle, and by far! <span id="ImportantPart">No one know why the top quark seems to be different</span> and people think it might be because it is connected to a new set of not-yet-known particles and interactions. It represents then also a good area to search for laws beyond the Standard Model.

<h3>Particle collider experiments</h3>
<p>
  In order to probe Nature at this scale, one needs to reach the highest energies since smaller distance always go with higher energy. A way to concentrate a lot of energy is
  to produce <span id="ImportantPart">collisions between very energetic particles</span>. Few facilities in the world allow to reach big enough collision energies to study
  physics at the electroweak scale. The last one was the Tevatron near Chicago (with proton-antiproton collision at 1.92 TeV) and the only currently working machine is
  the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva (with proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV).

<p>
  In order to establish what happened during the collision at the microscopic level, it is necessary to <span id="ImportantPart">measure all the out-going particles which are produced</span>.
  This is done with very complex detectors measuring energy deposits and tracks in all directions of space. The hadronic calorimer of the ATLAS experiment is one the
  <a target="_blank" href="research.html#detectorRD">sub-dectector on which I work on</a>, involved in these measurements. All together, every sub-detectors allow <span id="ImportantPart">physicists to reconstruct the full collision</span> by knowing, let say, if there were an electron in this direction or a muon in that direction. Sophisticated alogorithms have to be developped in order to recognize a give particle from all the energy deposit the detector sees: those are called particle reconstruction and identification. In particular, I worked on <a target="_blank" href="research.html#tauID">identification of tau lepton</a> (a kind of very heavy electron).
</p>

</div>
</div>

<br>

<p>
  Once every particle is identified using the detector, physicist are actually able to <span id="ImportantPart">select collision where a specific particle were produced</span>, like the Higgs boson, that was the highest goal in particle physics during the last decades and that was discovered in 2012. I partipcated to his <a target="_blank" href="research.html#higgsWW">search at the Tevatron</a> and to <a target="_blank" href="research.html#higgsTauTau">the evidence of one of his properties at the LHC</a>. It is also very important to <span id="ImportantPart">search for collisions which are not predicited by the Standard Model</span> (or not with the same rate) to discover new physics laws. I am participating to <a target="_blank" href="research.html#newphysics">search for new physics with the ATLAS detector</a> in event with two lepton having the same electric charge.

<h1>Search for new physics in the top quark sector</h1>

<p>
  <span id="ImportantPart">The top quark is the heaviest known particle</span> in the Standard Model and deserve then a special attention. A search for new physics in the top quarks sector can be performed in collisions with two leptons with the same electric charge and some b jets. This final state is sensitive to <span id="ImportantPart">many beyond the Standard Model signatures</span> and was already studied at the LHC Run 1. This analysis is <span id="ImportantPart">being performed for the LHC Run 2 data</span> and a preliminary public result is available with a fraction of Run 2 data. Below, few details are
  given concerning the physics motivations and <a target="_blank" href="research.html#Run1FourTop">the Run 1 results</a> as well as a <a target="_blank" href="research.html#UpdateRun2FourTop">Run 2 update</a>.
</p>

<h3>Top quark pair production</h3>

<p>
<span id="ImportantPart">LHC collisions produce many top-antitop pairs</span> allowing to precisely measure top quark properties.
Once produced, the top quark almost immediatly decay into a W boson and a b quark leading to 3 typical final states for top-antitop, depending on the W boson decay, with 0, 1 or 2 leptons. This kind
of collision is now well known and any deviation from what we expect could be a sign for new phenomena.

<h3>Four top quarks final state - Run 1</h3>

<p>The question is how many top quark can we produce in a single collision? In fact, the top quark can be also singly produced (via electroweak interaction
    rather than strong interaction in case of pair production). Here, the appraoch to <span id="ImportantPart">search for new physics is to look for four top
    quark production</span>, since the rate predicted by the <span id="ImportantPart">Standard Model is very low</span> for this production, and its signature
    can be quite spectacular and then easy to extract from known processes. But how new particle or interaction could enhence four top quark production?
    In the Standard Model, <span id="ImportantPart">there is no direct interaction between top quarks</span> since they always interact via gluon
    exchange. Let's <span id="ImportantPart">assume there is a new interaction between top quarks</span> mediated by a very heavy particle (too heavy
    to be directly produced at the LHC). Then, this would appear at the LHC energy scale as a <span id="ImportantPart">direct interaction between
    top quarks</span>, leading to four top quarks production. The interesting feature in this approach is that the experimental signature doesn't
    depend on the structure of the new interaction.

<p>
Selecting collisions with <span id="ImportantPart">two leptons with the same electric charge</span> allows to get four top quarks production.
The number of Standard Model processes leading to such a signature is reasonably low so the dominant <span id="ImportantPart">background for this analysis is mostly related to detector
effects</span> leading, for example, to the wrong charge assignment. In this case, processes creating two opposit sign leptons (like top-antitop pair production)
could be wrongly identified as a same-sign dilepton collision. The data collected by ATLAS during the Run 1 were analyzed and an
<span id="ImportantPart">interesting excess of observed data</span> were found with respect to the expected background. This result allowed to set limit on new physics models and was published in
<a target="_blank" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2015)150">JHEP <b>10</b> (2015) 150</a>.

<h3>Four top quarks final state - Run 2 update</h3>

<p>
  In June 2016, we released a <span id="ImportantPart">preliminary
  result based on Run 2 data</span> collected in 2015, having a center-of-mass energy 60% higher, detailed in
  <a target="_blank" href="http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2016-032/">ATLAS-CONF-2016-032</a>. The constraints are much more stringent (as shown in figures below), especially for processes requiring high energy such as four top quarks production, but the modest excess is not present anymore (with 3.2 fb<sup>-1</sup> of data). This result has been presented in several international
  conferences such as <a target="_blank" href="http://lhcp2016.hep.lu.se/">LHCP2016</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ichep2016.org/">ICHEP2016</a>. An update with more data
  is now in preparation.

<p>The ATLAS hadronic calorimeter is a subdetector of ATLAS dedicated to <span id="ImportantPart">energy measurement of hadrons</span>, particles made of quarks (such as proton, neutron or pions), heavily produced in proton-proton
collisions. This subdetector is made of an <span id="ImportantPart">alternance of steel and scintillating tiles</span>. Steel plates allow to interact with incoming hadrons during which many
secondary particles are produced. Scintillating tiles produce light when one of these secondary particles go through. This light, reflecting the <span id="ImportantPart">energy of the initial hadron</span>, is collected
via optical fiber and <span id="ImportantPart">converted in electric signal</span> by photomultipliers.

<h3> High Luminosity LHC </h3>
<p>
  The high luminosity LHC is a project for 2023 aiming to <span id="ImportantPart">upgrade the LHC</span> to produce proton-proton collision with <span id="ImportantPart">a much higher rate</span> than today. This allows to capture possible <span id="ImportantPart">rare phenonmenon</span> and also

It reads the charge delivered by the photomultiplier, shape the pulse and digitize it so that it can be analyzed to extract the <span id="ImportantPart">energy corresponding the collected light</span> and the time at which it was deposited. The readout electronics must satisfy several specifications in term of <span id="ImportantPart">precision, noise, response linearity but also in term of radiation hardness</span>.

  FATALIC is based on <span id="ImportantPart">130nm technology</span> build in three different blocks: a current conveyer able to directly read a current (and not a voltage), a shaper and an Analog-Digital Converter (ADC).

In addition, this demonstrator allows to <span id="ImportantPart">compare the various options</span> of readout electronics, which are designed by different labs. In practice, a lot of tests can be done without real particles, for example using <span id="ImportantPart">electronic charge injection system</span> (needed for in-situe calibration). The <span id="ImportantPart">communication between the different components</span> of the readout chain (very front-end, frond-end, back-end) are also studied on this demonstrator. However, it is crucial at some point to see how the <span id="ImportantPart">demonstrator reacts to real particles</span> and this is done using <span id="ImportantPart">particle beam provided by the CERN facilities</span>. The demonstrator is then measuring electrons, muons

<p>
 Unlike couplings to electroweak bosons, <span id="ImportantPart">couplings between the Higgs boson and fermions are not constrained by any symmetry</span>.
 Thus, measuring the branching ratio of the Higgs boson decaying into a fermion pair is testing a part of the Standard Model, called <span id="ImportantPart">Higgs Yukawa sector</span>,
 which has no fundamental reason to be like we think it is. They are two fermions which provide a good opportunity to experimentally probe the Yukawa part of
 the Higgs sector: the b quarks and the tau lepton. Both benefits from a significant branching ratio but are <span id="ImportantPart">extremely challenging</span>
 from the experimental point of view.
</p>


<p>
  If we focus on the <span id="ImportantPart">tau-tau final state</span>, there are three actual different final states seen by the detector depending on how each tau lepton will decay (more details <a href="research.html#tauID">here</a>) , namely tau<sub>lep</sub>tau<sub>lep</sub> (dilepton final state), tau<sub>lep</sub>tau<sub>had</sub> (lepton plus a hadronically decaying tau lepton) and tau<sub>had</sub>had<sub>lep</sub> (two hadronically decaying tau lepton). Since tau leptons decays before reaching the detecor, they have to <span id="ImportantPart">be identified from their decay products</span>.
  Hadronically decaying tau lepton are particularly challenging to identify among jets, largely produced in hadronic collider
  (for more details, see my <a target="_blank" href="research.html#tauID">researches on tau lepton identification</a>). On top of the <span id="ImportantPart">instrumental
  background</span> due to the hadronic final states, there is an <span id="ImportantPart">irreducible background where a Z boson decays into tau-tau</span> having the exact same final state of the collision we are looking for.

I mostly participated to the <span id="ImportantPart">tau<sub>lep</sub>tau<sub>had</sub> analysis</span> exploiting a lot of properties to extract the signal from
the fake tau lepton background and the Z boson production. For example, specifically looking a collisions where the <span id="ImportantPart">(tau,tau) system is highly boosted</span>
allowed to significantly reduce the background while keeping a good fraction of the signal. Actually, one of the biggest achievement was to use a <span id="ImportantPart">multivariate
analysis to optimally exploit these numerous properties</span> together and <span id="ImportantPart">reach a good enough sensitivity</span> to actually see the Higgs boson production in the
tau-tau decay mode. At the end, the analysis was based on six different categories of events, classified depending on their topology. Each of them had a dedicated set of observables entering in the final MVA.

This channel is particularly relevant because it allows to <span id="ImportantPart">access to one of the finger print of the Higgs boson</span>.
Indeed, one of the specificity of the Higgs boson is that his coupling to
other particle follow a very simple law: it is proportional to the masse of the particle. The coupling between electroweak boson and the Higgs boson are well measured
(Higg boson decay into two vector bosons - W, Z, photon - were actually the golden channel to discover the Higgs boson), but <span id="ImportantPart">what's about the fermions?</span>
The coupling to the top quark is well known but only accessible indirectly. <span id="ImportantPart">The direct observation of couplings between the Higgs boson and a fermion
is provided by the tau-tau channel</span>. And once again, the observation is in good agreement with prediction from the Standard Model. For more details, see <a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2015-044/">ATLAS-CONF-2015-044</a>.

<h3>Search for Higgs boson decaying into WW in the mu+tau final state at D&#216</h3>


<p>
  <span id="ImportantPart">The Tevatron collider</span> was mostly sensitive to the WW decay channel for a Higgs boson mass of m<sub>H</sub>=165 GeV. Indeed H almost always decays
  in this mode for m<sub>H</sub> ~ 2 m<sub>W</sub>. Experimentally, the e-e, e-mu and mu-mu final state are the easiest to identify and to reconstruct, in particular
  on a hadronic collider. However, before the LHC started, the Tevatron was the <span id="ImportantPart">only collider able to constrain the Higgs sector</span> and it was important
  to exploit every possible channels, including tau lepton channels.
</p>

<p>
  The strategy was then to search for this Higgs boson in <span id="ImportantPart">mu+tau events</span>, coming from WW decay of the Higgs boson
    where one W decays into a muon and a neutrino and the other decays into a tau and a neutrino:
  $$
  pp \to H \to W+W \to \mu\nu_{\mu} + \tau\nu_{\tau}
  $$
  
  Since tau leptons decays before reaching the detecor, they have to <span id="ImportantPart">be identified from their decay products</span>. Hadronically decaying tau lepton
  are particularly challenging to identify among jets, largely produced in hadronic collider (for more details, see my <a target="_blank" href="research.html#tauID">researches on tau lepton identification</a>).
  Therefore, <span id="ImportantPart">the main background of this search
  is the production of W boson is association with jets</span>, where the W boson decays into a muon and a jet is wrongly identified as hadronically decaying tau lepton.

  Even more important than reducing the background, is <span id="ImportantPart">how to accurately estimate it</span>. Indeed, this part is crucial since we search for
  an excess of collision with respect to a predicted number of background collisions. The number of background events coming from
  W+jets strongly depends on how frequently a jet can look like tau<sub>had</sub>, which is quite difficult to model using simulation.
  <span id="ImportantPart">That is why a dedicated method based on data was elaborated in order to correct the simulation</span>.
  </p>

  
  <p>
  In order to separate collisions from background processes and collisions where H were produced, <span id="ImportantPart">a multi-variate analysis (MVA) approach was adopted</span>. Many observables
  allowing to help identifying signal collision were combined in a Neural Network (NN) in order to get an optimal discriminant exploiting all the physics behind the background
  and the Higgs boson production. Using this strategy, <span id="ImportantPart">the experimental sensitvity to H production reached 8 times the SM predicted rate</span>.

<h1> Tau lepton in hadrons collider</h1>

<h3> Why tau lepton are challenging? </h3>

<p>The tau lepton is the <span id="ImportantPart">heaviest known lepton</span> and it is also the only one decaying after a very short distance (~100 micrometers).
Thus, if one wants to <span id="ImportantPart">probe particle decaying into tau leptons</span>, one need to reconstruct them from they decay products. It also means that the reconstructed particles must be identified as a tau lepton decay, which might not always be trivial depending on the decay mode. They are two kinds of decay decay modes: <span id="ImportantPart">35% of leptonic decay</span> (with one neutrino) and <span id="ImportantPart">65% of hadronic decay</span> (with two neutrinos). The leptonic decay gives either an electron or a muon which are relatively easy to reconstruct (but impossible to distinguish from lepton originating from heavy boson). The hadronic decay mode is more tricky because it is subdivided in 3 main types of signature, depending on the hadrons produced in the decay. In addition, <span id="ImportantPart">hadrons are heavily produced in hadronic collisions and will easily mimic tau leptons</span>.

<p>
Since tau lepton mostly decay into hadrons, it is quite <span id="ImportantPart">important to be able to identify them among all hadrons produced in a collision,
in particular, those from jets</span> - experimental signature of a quark. This is done exploiting <span id="ImportantPart">specific properties of the hadrons coming from the tau decay</span>.
For example, hadrons from a tau will be <span id="ImportantPart">very collimated</span> and not very numerous (mostly 1, 2 or 3). Looking around the most energetic hadron will also provide a good insight
whether this is a hadronic tau - <span id="ImportantPart">low activity, few tracks and energy deposit</span> - or a jet - high activity, many tracks and energy deposits. The <span id="ImportantPart">fraction of charged hadrons and neutral hadrons</span> will also be a nice handle to distinguish between hadronic taus and jets.
</p>


<h3> How to improve hadronic tau identification </h3>
<p>I worked on several aspects to <span id="ImportantPart">better identify hadronics taus</span>. First, I tried to explore detailed properties of the hadronic decay.
For example, in some cases a particular hadron is produced a &#x3C1, decaying into a neutral and a charged pions. It means that the two final pions will have a particular correlation when they come from a tau, which won't be the case if they are randomely produced in a jet. At D&#216, I developped a <span id="ImportantPart">dedicated algorithm to reconstruct close-by photons coming from neutral pion decay, using scintillating strip detector</span> in D&#216. Several other ideas were tested in order better reject fake taus, based on physics but also on <span id="ImportantPart">sophisticated data analysis like a neutral network</span>. The result was a significant improvement of tau identification efficiency, 20% on signal (true taus) over background (jets) ratio.</p>
