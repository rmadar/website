   <p> I was in charge of example classes for <span id="ImportantPart">advanced particle physics</span> lecture in <a href="https://portal.uni-freiburg.de/jakobs" target="_blank">Karl Jakobs group</a>, at Freiburg University (Germany). This lecture basically covers the <span id="ImportantPart">genesis of the Standard Model</span>, the experimental validations and a presentation of phenonena beyond the Standard Model.
  Also, the <span id="ImportantPart">formalism to link a theory to observables</span> is discussed in different context (collider physics, neutrino oscillation, low energy limits..)</p>

<p>
  The exercises that were given to the students started with mostly formalism and slowly turned into <span id="ImportantPart">pratical work</span> using collision simulations. Students had to analyze them with <a href="https://root.cern.ch/" target="_blank" title="website">ROOT</a> in order to <span id="ImportantPart">link collisions to the underlying fundamental theory</span>. Below are listed the topics which were covered in the exercises.

      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">1. Relativistic Kinematics and Neutrino Oscillation</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">This sheet targets the basics of special relativity, namely time "dilation" and distance "contraction" as well as energy thresholds in different type of collisions. It also contains a first description of neutrino oscillations (two flavours scheme).</p>
    </a>
    
    <a target="_blank" href="../doc/teaching/ueb2.pdf" title="Pdf file"class="list-group-item">

      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">3. Description of spin-1/2 Particles: Dirac Field</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">This sheet presents the dynamic of the elementary block of matter, the spin-1/2 particles. First the free solution of the Dirac equation are derived, then few relativistic
      invariants are build from Dirac bi-spinnors. The low energy limit of Dirac equation is studied to demonstrate the famous "g=2" equation.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text">The basics of the top quark is detailed, and the consequences in term of experimental strategy are also discussed in this sheet. As an illustration
    a simulation of top-antitop production is analyzed. In particular, a method of the top mass reconstruction is proposed, based on semi-leptonic decay of the top-antitop pair.</p>
    </a>
    
   <a target="_blank" href="../doc/teaching/ueb9.pdf" title="Pdf file"class="list-group-item">
    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">9. Few Aspects of the Electroweak Interaction</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text">In this sheet, the consequences of the V-A structure of the electroweak interaction are explored (from meson decays to helicity/direction correlations).
    Then, the muon decay is formally strudied and formulas are related to experimental data to extract some of the fundamental parameters of the theory.</p>

However, the <span id="ImportantPart">approach was more qualitative</span> than computational allowing to touch several physics topics. For example, <span id="ImportantPart">sound propagation, fluid statics or coupled oscillators</span> were quickly discussed (while this would be done in L2 or L3 in France).

  <div class="col-md-9 vcenter">
   <p>
     When I was doing my PhD, I got in charge of an entire lecture: <span id="ImportantPart">introduction to mathematics for physics</span>. The context was a bit special since it was for <span id="ImportantPart">continuing education</span> of technicians in order to become engineer. I had to design from scratch an full progression starting from high school mathematics toward common tools used in physics such as vectorial calculus or functions with several variables. It was really interesting to <span id="ImportantPart">make concepts clear</span> with a minimal - but necessary - touch of formalism, while <span id="ImportantPart">keeping the operational know-how</span> of mathematics applied to basic situations. People following the training came from <span id="ImportantPart">several
     areas with multiple scientific backgrounds</span>. This lecture was done in <a href="http://www.polytech.u-psud.fr/fr/entreprise/formation-continue-vae.html" target="_blank" title="website">Polytech Paris Sud</a> engineer school, and the only available material is a <a href="http://madar-maths-ifips.blogspot.fr" target="_blank" title="website">french blog</a> I wrote back in 2009!

      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">0. Why the mathematics in physics?</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text"> Such a vast and deep question ... In this pre-introduction chapter, the goal is just to explain the place of the mathematics in the description of Nature. Prediction,
      make concepts effective via formalism, quatitative analysis, precisions ... In two words: no mathematics, no understanding of Nature! Why? If only somone knew...
      </p>
    </a>
  
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">1. Basics of analysis, algebra and geometry</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">The basic mathematics tool box of high school student is presented here, to make sure everyone starts with the same level. Usual functions, simple algebra and geometry are reviewed.
      </p>
    </a>
    
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">2. Hyperbolic functions</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text"> This chapter simply introduce even and odd component of exponantial function. Applications in physics in cases where symmetries are explicit through boudary conditions. The Ising model solution, given by hyperbolic tangente, is also discussed in a new context: how a decision is made in a company!
      </p>
    </a>
    
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">3. Taylor series</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">This notion is obviously needed in many contexts, such as undetermined limits or resolution of non-linear equation in a given limit. The fundamental idea is presented, and the main technics to compute taylor series are discussed. Key examples are shown, such as the classical - but so fundamental - hamonic oscillator.</p>
    </a>
      
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">4. Integrals</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Integrals are introduced as contious sum of numbers (Riemann sum) and the relation with primitives is given with its demonstration. Several technics of integrals computations and approximation are presented, as well as few examples in mechanics (time evolution), statistics (average) or continous medium (mass density) are discussed.</p>
    </a>
  
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">5. Function with several variables</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Since one need to describe system which depends on many numbers (position in 3D space, time, etc ...), these function with several variables are a mandatory tool for physicists. This chapter generalizes every concept to this type of function: representation, derivation, taylor series, and integration. As a full example, the first degree polynom which minimize the $\chi^2$ for a given data sample is fully derived.</p>
    </a>
  
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">6. Vector calculus</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Evaluating dynamics of fields require richer tools than derivatives. This section introduces them, up to the famous Green-Ostrogradsky theorem (link between flux and divergence) and the link between rotational and circulation. These tools in hands, Maxwell equations can be exploited such as well as any type of physics laws based on fields (ie pretty much all of them)!</p>
    </a>
    
    <a class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">7. Linear and partial differential equations</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Differential equation are clearly the corner stone of the mathematical expression of physics laws. The basic mathematical theorem and methods related to differential eqautions are given, as well as key example such as conductivity model. As an example of partial differential equations, thermal diffusion and wave propagation are studied.</p>
    </a>
  
    <a class="list-group-item">
     <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">8. Introduction to matricial formalism</h4>
     <p class="list-group-item-text">A (very) short introduction to matrices is presented in this last chapter, based on the resolution of several linea equations. The operations on matrix are given, as well as
     the matrix inversion using the determinant (defined as the volume generated by each vector which makes the matrix).</p>
